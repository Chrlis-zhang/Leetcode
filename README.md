## About
[简体中文](https://github.com/Miksztowi/Leetcode/blob/master/doc/README_CHINESE.md)

This project includes some **Leetcode's** solutions and all of them are coded by **Python**.In order to handily compare the efficiency of different solutions, I pasted corresponding **Runtime**/**Runtime Beats**  on top of the code.If you still have confusion after reading code, you can look over the tips in the corresponding commit.

## Usage
Just use Ctrl+F and search by title.
